summary: A Python-based resource monitor for your terminal. 
description: |
  The goal of this project is to produce a useful tool for arranging terminals. 
  It is inspired by programs such as gnome-multi-term, quadkonsole, etc. in that 
  the main focus is arranging terminals in grids (tabs is the most common default
  method, which Terminator also supports).

  When you run Terminator, you will get a terminal in a window, just like almost every other 
  terminal emulator available. There is also a titlebar which will update as shells/programs
  inside the terminal tell it to. Also on the titlebar is a small button that opens the 
  grouping menu. From here you can put terminals into groups, which allows you to control
  multiple terminals simultaneously.
